I have a history in veterinary medicine as a Registered Veterinary Technician for theb last 10 years. I currently have 2 cats and a horse (who is teally judt a big cat). In my free time I love hopping on the Xbox to wind down with some video games.

I am currently taking the TripleTen bootcamp for Business Intelligence Analytics. I am confident in using:
Excel
SQL
Tableau 

I am looking for entry level projects to get a foot in the industry.
